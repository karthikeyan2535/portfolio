          I'm a third-year B.Tech student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, specializing in Information Technology.
Driven by a passion for Data Structures & Algorithms, Competitive Programming, Full Stack Web Development, and Blockchain Technology, I strive to bridge the gap between theory and practical application.
Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve developed a solid foundation in Operating Systems, Object-Oriented Programming, Computer Networks, and Database Management Systems, and have applied these concepts to real-world projects.
I have built several projects that showcase my expertise in both web development and blockchain technologies.
